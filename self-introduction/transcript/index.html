            <h4>Hello there!</h4>
            <p>My name is Yana, and let me share a bit about myself.</p>
            <p>
                I am thirty years old, and I am an emergency doctor by
                education. Currently, I work in the emergency department.
            </p>
            <p>
                In school, I had a genuine passion for math and physics. I
                adored solving different tasks, especially those involving
                logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, my interest in biology and chemistry led me to
                pursue admission to medical university. That's why I became a
                doctor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three years ago, I realized that I wanted to delve into the
                world of coding. Ask me Why? Because it's not just a job to me -
                it's a passion.
            </p>
            <p>
                I find programming incredibly fascinating, especially with the
                constant advancements in technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's always something new to learn, and that excites me
                endlessly. So, I started by learning C++, but later got hooked
                on web development. That's why I chose to learn JavaScript,
                followed by TypeScript and React.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am enrolled in the Rolling Scope School, where I
                hope to achieve success.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I work with a small team comprising a UI/UX
                designer, quality assurance specialists, backend, and another
                frontend developer. Together, we are collaborating on a pet
                project - an online store named Brave Wheels.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, you can often find me immersed in coding
                challenges on platforms like GitHub and Codewars. I also enjoy
                connecting with fellow enthusiasts on Discord and Telegram,
                exchanging ideas and insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, I like to do sports, to watch different movies and
                cartoons, to draw. Currently, I am undergoing training for a
                driver's license.
            </p>
            <p>I am a hardworking person and a team-player.</p>
            <p>
                So, that's a little snippet of who I am - a frontend developer
                with a passion for learning, growing, and making a meaningful
                impact in the world of technology.
            </p>
            <p>I wish you all of good luck and a lot of patience. Bye.</p>
